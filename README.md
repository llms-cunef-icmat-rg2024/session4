# Session 4 - Some RLHF examples

This repo contains two examples of differents RLHF methods for two different problems. It relies on the `trl` package from huggingface, 
[docs here](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index).

Install the dependencies with `pip install transformers trl peft datasets`.


## Example 1: PPO for Sentiment Analysis

It finetunes the GPT-2 model on IMDB movie review prompts to steer the model towards positive sentiment. 

[./ppo-sentiment.ipynb](./ppo-sentiment.ipynb) contains the code to run the example.

(Example taken from trl's documentation)

## Example 2: DPO for Safety

It finetunes a 7B model on a custom synthetic safety dataset, to avoid harmful or illegal content. It uses LoRA, so it can run on a 16GB GPU, such as the ones on Google Colab.

Some example of the behavior of the model pre- and post-finetuning:

| Prompt | Model | Generation |
|--------|---------------------|------------|

It is crucial to be cautious and aware of phishing scams and avoid sharing sensitive data via email, text message, or website. Always ensure that the source of any communication is legitimate and verify the website's or email address's authenticity.
